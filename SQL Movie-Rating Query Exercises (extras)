Question 1
Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind.

SELECT DISTINCT Reviewer.name
FROM Reviewer, Rating, Movie
WHERE Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID
AND Movie.mID = Rating.mID
AND Movie.title = "Gone with the Wind"

Question 2
For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the movie, 
return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars. 

SELECT Reviewer.name, Movie.title, Rating.stars
FROM Reviewer, Movie, Rating
WHERE Reviewer.name = Movie.director
AND Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID
AND Movie.mID = Rating.mID;

Question 3
Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, alphabetized. 
(Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word in the title is fine; 
no need for special processing on last names or removing "The".) 

SELECT Reviewer.name
FROM Reviewer
UNION
SELECT Movie.title
FROM Movie

Question 4
Find the titles of all movies not reviewed by Chris Jackson. 

SELECT DISTINCT Movie.title
FROM Movie
EXCEPT 
SELECT  Movie.title
FROM Movie, Reviewer, Rating
WHERE Reviewer.name = "Chris Jackson"
AND Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID
AND Movie.mID = Rating.mID

Question 5
For all pairs of reviewers such that both reviewers gave a rating to the same movie, return the names of both reviewers. Eliminate duplicates, don't pair reviewers with themselves, and include each pair only once. For each pair, return the names in the pair in alphabetical order.

SELECT DISTINCT R1.name, R2.name
FROM Reviewer R1, Reviewer R2, Rating RT1, Rating RT2 
WHERE R1.name < R2.name
AND RT1.rID = R1.rID
AND RT2.rID = R2.rID
AND RT1.mID = RT2.mID
ORDER BY R1.name
